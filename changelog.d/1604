synopsis: Full query string helpers
prs: #1604

description: {
  This PR introduces `DeepQuery`, a route combinator that implements a pattern commonly known as deep objects.
  It builds upon the convention of using `[]` for a list of parameters: 
  `books?filter[search]=value&filter[author][name]=value`.
  The corresponding type would be `DeepQuery "filter" BookQuery :> Get '[JSON] [Book]`.

}
